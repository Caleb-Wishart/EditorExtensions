## Editor Extensions
Extends the Factorio map editor with new tools and utilities, and makes tweaks to aid with sandbox play. Adds a suite of supercharged items and entities to assist with testing setups, and allows for easy and painless switching between the editor and normal play.

### Testing tools

This mod includes a ton of items and tools to aid with testing your setups. Supercharged robots, energy-free inserters, infinite item, fluid, heat, and electricity manipulation, and overpowered modules are just a few of the tools at your disposal.

These tools are normally only available inside of the editor. If you would like to access them while in normal play, use the `/cheat` command.

### Mode switching

This mod adds a shortcut button to toggle the map editor. This makes it painless to switch to the editor when you need it, and switch back when you want to have a body again. You can also toggle modes with `Ctrl + Shift + E`.
